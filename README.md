# `js` (WIP)
> A CLI for javascript

Like PureScript's [`pulp`](https://github.com/bodil/pulp) but for javascript.

# Usage

```sh
npm install --global jscli

js --help
```

## Scaffolds

To initialize a project run

```sh
js init <scaffold> -o path/to/my-project
```

`<scaffold>` should be a name of a folder in `scaffolds`.
the `-o` is optional and will default to the current directory.
